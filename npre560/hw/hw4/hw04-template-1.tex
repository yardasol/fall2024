        \question (Hetrick 6-3, 6-4, 6-5, 6-6, 6-7, 6-8) Below, G(s)H(s) is the open-loop transfer function. For each,

        \question[20] (D\&H 6-26) Explicitly perform the Laplace transform 
        inversion of the zero power transfer function, $Z(s)$ to obtain the

        \question[30] (D\&H 6-23) Calculate the amplitude and phase angle for the 
        zero power transfer function and plot these as functions of frequency. 
        Assume one group of delayed neutrons with $\beta = 0.0065$, $\lambda = 
        0.08s^{-1}$, and $\Lambda = 10^{-4}s$.

        \question[10] (D\&H 6-32) In a prompt critical reactor excursion, a 
        large amount of reactivity (measured above prompt critical) $\rho_0$ is 
        instantaneously inserted in an equillibrium reactor at $t=0$. Assume 
        that:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item the effect of delayed neutrons is negligible on the time 
                        scales under consideration.
                \item the reactor shuts itself down by thermal expansion of the 
                        core in such a way that negative reactivity is 
                        ``added'' proportional to the total heat energy 
                        generated up to time $t$. That is, $\rho = \rho_0 - 
                        \gamma\int_0^t{P(t')dt'}$. 
        \end{itemize}

        Find the power level $P(t)$  where $t$ is measured from the time of 
        reactivity insertion, and is measured in units of the prompt neutron lifetime.
        [This is known as the Fuchs-Hansen model of reactor excursion.]
