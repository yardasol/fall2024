\begin{questions}
        \question (Ott Review 6.20) Describe in words, with graphs, and with 
        formulas the transient following a step change in reactivity or source:
        \begin{parts}
                \part[5] Without delayed neutrons.
                \begin{solution}
                        solution here
                \end{solution}

                \part[5] With constant delayed neutron source.
                \begin{solution}
                        solution here
                \end{solution}

                \part[5] With no approximations (no formula required).
                \begin{solution}
                        solution here
                \end{solution}

        \end{parts}

        % ---------------------------------------------
        \question (Ott Review 6.34) Estimate the time it takes to establish the 
        stable asymptotic transient for $\rho_1 < \beta$ in an initially 
        critical reactor.
                \begin{solution}
                        solution here
                \end{solution}


        % ---------------------------------------------
        \question[10] (Ott Review 6.35) Explain in terms of roots of the 
        characteristic equation:
        \begin{parts}
                \part[5] the prompt jump phenomenon
                \begin{solution}
                        solution here.
                \end{solution}
                \part[5] the delayed neutron induced transition
                \begin{solution}
                        solution here.
                \end{solution}
                \part[5] the stable period 
                \begin{solution}
                        solution here.
                \end{solution}
        \end{parts}

        
        % ---------------------------------------------
        \question[30] (Ott Problem 8.1) Find the numerical value of $p^{00}$, 
        the flux after a prompt jump for which the increase due to delayed 
        neutrons is just compensated by Doppler feedback, for an LWR from the 
        typical $\lambda$ and $\gamma/\beta$ values given in the text. Discuss 
        why $p^{00}$ may vary between reactors (e.g. the SEFOR reactor 
        discussed in the text).

        \begin{solution}
                solution here.
        \end{solution}

        % ---------------------------------------------
        \question[15] (Ott Review 8.1) Define each term, give an example of the 
        physical phenomena involved, and an example of a transient for each: 
        \begin{parts}
                \part[5] Energy coefficient.
                \part[5] Temperature coefficient. of reactvity.
                \part[5] Power coeffciient.
