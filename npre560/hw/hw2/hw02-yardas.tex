\begin{questions}
        \question (Ott Problem 3.3)
        \begin{parts}
                \part[5] Define a one-group $\nu\Sigma_f$ based on the two 
                group values 
                $\nu \Sigma_{f1} = 0.015 \left[\frac{1}{cm}\right]$ and 
                $\nu \Sigma_{f2} = 0.3 \left[\frac{1}{cm}\right]$.
                \begin{solution}
                    Let's assume the weigting of each energy group is $0.5$. We
                    can then calculate 
                    \begin{align*}
                        \nu \Sigma_{f} &= 0.5 \nu \Sigma_{f1} + 0.5 \nu
                            \Sigma_{f2} \\
                        &= 0.5 * 0.015 \text{cm}^{-1} + 0.5 * 0.3
                            \text{cm}^{-1}\\
                        &= 0.1575 \text{cm}^{-1}
                    \end{align*}
                \end{solution}

                \part[5] Calculate $\Lambda$ with $\bar{v}$ and with 
                $\bar{\frac{1}{v}}$.
                \begin{solution}
                    Suppose our one-group neutrons are at 0.025 eV. Then their
                    velocity is
                    \begin{align*}
                        \bar{v} &= \sqrt{\frac{2E}{m_{n}}} \\
                        &= \sqrt{\frac{2 * 0.025 \text{eV} * 1.602 * 10^{-19}
                            \frac{\text{J}}{\text{eV}}}{1.6749 * 10^{-27}
                            \text{kg}}} \\
                        &= 2186 \text{m/s}
                    \end{align*}
                \end{solution}

        \question (Ott Review 3.8)
        \begin{parts}
                \part[5] Give the formula for $\beta_{eff}$ in the one 
        group approximation.
                \begin{solution}
                    In one group, we have
                    \begin{equation}
                        \beta_\text{eff} = \frac{\nu_{d} \Sigma_{f}}{\nu
                        \Sigma_{f}}
                    \end{equation}
                    where $\nu_{d}$ is the delayed neutron yield from fission.
                \end{solution}

                \part[10] Which physical fact is described by $\beta_{eff}$ in 
                this approximation?
                \begin{solution}
                    $\beta_\text{eff}$ describes the fraction of delayed
                    neutrons produced from fission.
                \end{solution}

        % ---------------------------------------------
        \question[10] (Ott Review 3.10) Why is the diffusion equation a reasonable 
        approximation for kinetics in large reactors?
        \begin{solution}
            According to Ott, multigroup diffusion theory using the appropriate
            cell averaged group constants is a good approximation for reactor
            statics, but has errors near reflectors and blankets at the edge of
            the core (as well as at control rods). For kinetics problems in
            large reactors, the reflector and blanket regions are of low
            importance for reactivity, as the adjoint flux in these regions will
            be small in a large reactor. Since the reactivity governs the
            time-dependence of the flux, applying the diffusion approxmation for
            deriving kinetics equations incurrs acceptably low errors.
        \end{solution}

        \question (Ott 4.4) Consider a perturbation of $+\delta \Sigma_a$ 
        for $r< r_a$ in a critical sphere. Assume $r_a$ is much less than the 
        critical radius, R. Find the corresponding change in the reactivity 
        using the unperturbed flux

                \part[5] from reaction rates
                        \begin{solution}
                            See Ott page 52
                        \end{solution}
                \part[5] from the first-order perturbation formula for the 
                one-group approximation.
                        \begin{solution}
                            The first order pertubation formula in the one-group
                            approximation is
                            \begin{equation}
                                \Delta \rho = \frac{(D_0B_0^{2} + \Sigma_{a0})
                                \Delta \nu \Sigma_{f}}{(\nu\Sigma_{f0})^{2}} -
                                \frac{\Delta \Sigma_{a})}{\nu
                                \Sigma_{f0}}
                            \end{equation}
                            In this case, our pertubation is simply $\Delta
                            \Sigma_{a} = \delta \Sigma_{a}$. $\Delta \nu
                            \Sigma_{f} = 0$, so we get
                            \begin{equation}
                                \Delta \rho = -\frac{\delta \Sigma_{a}}{\nu
                                \Sigma_{f0}}
                            \end{equation}
                        \end{solution}
        \end{parts}

        \question[5] (Ott Review 5.4) What does ``exact'' mean in the context 
        of exact point kinetics equations?
        \begin{solution}
            ``Exact'' means we abandon the simplifying assumptions we
            made for one-group point kinetics (for example, we assume that
            flux is {\it not} separable in time). This will yield improved
            equations for our integral parameters ($\rho$, $\Lambda$, $\beta$)
            as well as power, $\zeta_{k}$, and $s(t)$.
